{"name":"BBQ Static Generator","tagline":"Static Generator for your GitHub Pages Blog","body":"BBQ Static Generator\r\n------\r\n\r\nCurrent status: Alpha\r\n\r\nThis is a static page generator written in Haskell. It is a library and you can start with the [scaffolding site](https://github.com/izgzhen/bbq-sg-template) to build your blog with it.\r\n\r\n### Highlights\r\n* Based on Shake build system to boost performance\r\n* Utilizing template haskell and shakespeare library to enhance the templating capacity\r\n* Modular design\r\n* JSON widget interface\r\n\r\n### Major difference between it and Hakyll\r\nYes, [Hakyll](https://github.com/jaspervdj/hakyll) is much more stable and popular, but bbq-sg is not just another reinvented wheel. First, this library tried hard to use the third-party libraries which is more universal & mature, rather than reinventing a small scope of functionalities inside the library itself.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
